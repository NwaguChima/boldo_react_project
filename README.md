## Getting Started

Interpreted the amazing Boldo UI figma desgin, using Nextjs and Sass for styling. No css library was used as it is often not known what a compay's css library is. All pages are responsive and fit all screen sizes.

## Pages

The Homepage and the about pages were both implemented as most of the components were made reusable, making it easier to share components and Logic.
The chats were just rendered as images, but could be implemented as a component using tooltip or ordinary css and the logic if needed.
Images were rendered using Next/Image, to help with the lazy loading and better overall performance as svg quality was used. In case of a real world application, various verison of the images would be used for responsive images, especially matching the size and quality of the screen.
